/**
 * Person.swift
 *
 * Person is a subclass of NSManagedObject. You will be modifying the Person class in the
 * "Plain Favorite Actors" Project so that it matches this file.
 *
 * There are 5 changes to be made. They are listed below, and called out in comments in the
 * code.
 *
 * 1. Import Core Data
 * 2. Make Person a subclass of NSManagedObject
 * 3. Add @NSManaged in front of each of the properties/attributes
 * 4. Include the standard Core Data init method, which inserts the object into a context
 * 5. Write an init method that takes a dictionary and a context. This is the biggest change to the class
